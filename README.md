# Data-Mining
Sentiment analysis in text project for Data Mining Master course (2023-2024)


Our project is focusing on sentiment analysis in text, specifically movie reviews written in Romanian. Our implementation is capable of classifying the overall sentiment behind a review as either positive or negative, based on the words used. Additionally, a scale between 0 and 1 is in place to determine how positive or negative a sentence is, this way also classifying the neutral sentences.


Our project is written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook. The main requirement is for Python 3.11 to be installed, being available in the Microsoft Store.
